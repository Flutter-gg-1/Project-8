### Problem Definition ⛔
Our client, a coffee shop owner, faces a common issue during rush hours: long lines cause customer frustration and lost sales. To address this, we developed an application that optimizes the ordering process, helping the business retain customers and reduce wait times.


### Goal 🚀
Onze Coffee is a user-friendly application designed to streamline the coffee buying process. It allows customers to order and track their coffee with ease, improving both customer experience and the efficiency of the coffee shop.


### Key Features 🎯
To ensure a seamless user experience, we’ve implemented key features such as:

### Coffee Shop Employees:

- View all customer orders.
- Update the status of orders (e.g., in progress, ready, completed).
- Access detailed information for each order.

### Customers:
- Browse the menu  
- view detailed descriptions of each item.
- Search for specific items.
- Add items to the cart and adjust quantities.
- Pay directly through the app (via credit card) or cash payment.
- Receive notifications about their order status.

### Guest:
if the user don't want to create an account he can explore the application as a guest 

### Tools and Technologies 📱
- **Figma:** For creating wireframes and designing the app interface.
